# CASTSampleCode
CAST is a children's search engine desighned to make searching on the web easier for kids K-4th grade. Each search word is filtered through a profanity filter, readability and reliability sorter, phonetic spell checker, and other classes to allow the best search possible.

In the example above, unnecsary words are put in light gray so users know what terms the search engine used. This helps kids learn how to make an efficeint search. For example, a child might search "what is the name of the cute snowman from frozen?". The function would gray out multiple words leaving "name" of "snowman frozen". This helps children learn not to type full sentences and improve thier search for next time.

If a word is mispelled, the word will appear in red with a bar of suggestions below it. Using a cusotom phonetic spell checker, a list of options will appear below. When hovered over, the word will be read allowed along with a small picture of what that word means. 

When the user hover over a website, a small preview will appear (from scraping front end) which allows the student to check if this it is what they were looking for before browsing the sight. This can help them find the same website from a teacher or previously used website more easily. Searches glow in light blue when hovered over to help the user not lose sight of the cursor or lose focus.

Additionally, children can star the searches that they found the most helpful. The website will remain starred for the next searches until the student exits the search session. 

Images, Videos, and news can also be viewed by clicking on the bar below CAST. On the admin page, teachers can view searches made by thier students, number of searches, and do replays of a students search in order to make sure the student is on task or see where they got lost or confused. 

The code provided is a very small sample of the code I reguarly worked with and created. Permission to make temporarily public granted by from Downs at Boise State University.
